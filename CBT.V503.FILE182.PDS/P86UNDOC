    `o+ The COMPRESS subcommand has a "SHR" operand which allows
        compressing data sets which are in use.

    `o+ / and ? are synonyms for the O(ptions) line command in all
        dialog table displays.

    `o+ . line command is equalivant to entering o.ut to display
        the user line command panel.

    `o+ Special control code "2" in all dialog table displays
        is the same as "X ALL".

    `o+ Special control code "4" or "=" (short hand character) in
        the MEMLIST table display is the same as "SUBLIST = MEMLIST".

    `o+ Short hand character "*" in the ISPMODE and MEMLIST
        table displays is the same as "MEMLIST *".

    `o+ To delete portions of a dialog table display:

        X ABOVE or UP    -  delete all lines above the current line
        X BELOW or DOWN  -  delete all lines below the current line
        X ALL            -  delete all lines
        X -nnn           -  delete nnn lines above the current line
        X nnn            -  delete nnn lines below the current line

    `o+ To swap between the dialog table displays:

        NORM - Swap to normal          display  (left  display)
        ALT  - Swap to alternate table display  (right display)
        DUAL - Swap to dual line or 3rd table display
               (LEFT and RIGHT scroll commands or PFK keys can be used)

       `Note:+Norm (N), Alt (A), and Dual (D) can be abbreviated.

    `o+ The ATTRIB subcommand has a single-line output format that is
        available for load modules; to use this format, enter SHORT as
        an ATTRIB keyword.

       `Note:+If this format message is requested, many standard module
        checks are not performed and an incorrectly created or modified
        load module will not be detected.

    `o+ MEMLIST Source Member List 3 displays creation date and last
        modification date in ccyy/mm/dd format.  The last modification
        time is displayed in hh:mm:ss format.  The XSTAT column denotes
        if extended ISPF statistics are present.

    `o+ LISTV (List Volumes) Display 3 displays space used on volume,
        number of cyls on volume, free VIRs, and fragmentation index.

    `o+ Column data in all dialog table displays can be sorted by
        clicking on the point-and-shoot column header.  Sort direction
        will reverse on subsequent clicks.  The color of these headers
        can be changed with the PSCOLOR command.

    `o+ IBM's SuperC or Comparex can be used as the PDS
        compare program.  Member COMXMIT contains the TSO command
        processors (COMPAREC and COMPAREW) in XMIT format.

        primary menu) has point-and-shoot selection fields.

    `o+ The CONTROL GLOBALMODS subcommand specifies that program
        messages should be output for each global variable from the
        #PDSGEN members which differs from the default value for that
        variable.

    `o+ The CONTROL ALLGLOBALS subcommand specifies that program
        messages should be output for each global variable from the

    `o+ The RLSE subcommand will display a FIXPDS panel to release
        unused directory blocks or unused allocated space.

    `o+ The EXPAND subcommand will display a FIXPDS panel to expand
        directory or space allocation.  This conflicts with the
        ISPF EXPAND command, so use EXPAN to display the panel.

    `o+ The USAGE subcommand will display SMS data (STORCLAS, MGMTCLAS,
        DATACLAS, and DSNTYPE) if the dataset is SMS managed.

    `o+ If PDS is invoked from ISPF option 3.4 (PGM=ISRUDL), the
        volser in the ISPF table display will be used instead of the
        volser that is cataloged if global variable &DSLIST is YES.

    `o+ The SET command will display the PDS Set Default Selection
        Menu.

    `o+ To change LRECL to zero, issue FIXPDS RECFM(U) followed by

        Suspend ISPF mode (special control code 1) or invoke PDS with
        the XISPMODE option.  When PDS subcommands are entered from a
        CLIST, YES/NO prompts are not provided; instead, YES responses
        are assumed in each case.

    `o+ To use the extended help facility after warning and/or error
        messages have been received, enter a .?  response to the ENTER
        OPTIONS prompt message and up to five warning or error message

        HELP data set by the program.

    `o+ The TAG command used on the command line of the MEMLIST function
        will set SUBLIST equal to selected members within the member
        list that have *TAG* in the data field.  Members can be "tagged"
        with the TAG line command.

    `o+ The LOG line command to format and copy a line to the
        session log must be entered as LO on prompting panels
        to avoid ISPF command table conflict.

    `o+ To use the ISO alternative date format (yy/mm/dd) in
        ATTRIB/IF/MEMLIST date options and ATTRIB/HISTORY/USAGE
        display output, follow the instructions given in member
        $$$ISODT of the install PDS.

    `o+ Member $$$CUSTM on install PDS describes how to use
        the ISPF facilities built into PDS for the express purpose
        of allowing users to add functions to PDS.  This can be
        done without modifying PDS internal code.

    `o+ Member $$$HERC on install PDS describes how to
        generate a version of PDS that will run in a MVS 3.8J
        Hercules environment.

    `o+ The CONTROL DSNAME(dsname) data set can be a pre-allocated
        RECFM=VB, LRECL=255 dataset.

    `o+ The MXIBAT subcommand invokes Rob Scott's MXI program in batch
        mode.

        partitioned data set offload program in batch mode.

    `o+ The DISASM subcommand invokes Dick Thorton's disassembler in
        batch mode.  IBM disassembler, ASMDASM, can also be used.

    `o+ The DLINK subcommand invokes David Noon's delinker in
        batch mode.

    `o+ The SMPGEN subcommand creates SMP/E controls for members.

    `o+ The CPKMAP subcommand displays a track map of a volume with
        FDR Compaktor.  CBT track mapper, DISKMAP, can also be used.

    `o+ The COBANAL subcommand displays an analysis of COBOL/PLI/C/C++
        and LE-enabled Assembler load modules.

    `o+ FIXPDS STOWINIT will issue a STOW Initialize for a PDS.

    `o+ ANALYZE is an alias of the COBANAL subcommand.

    `o+ CREATE will invoke the ISPF 3.2 dialog.

    `o+ A subcommand called QUIT was added to terminate PDS.

    `o+ The LONG operand in HISTORY will display ISPF size statistics in
        99,999,999 format for source libraries.

    `o+ PDS programming notes from William Finkelstein.

       "Tom Springer, Steve Smith and I were all at Security
        Bank when we did the bulk of the work on PDS in the
        in the '70s.  The ISPF support started at Security in the
        '70s and as I recall I wrote the first version of it
        and Steve wrote version 2 and beyond."

    `o+ XISPMODE is an alias for the ISPMODE session control code 1,
        Suspend ISPF.  This is available in the Session Display and
        MEMLIST dialogs.

    `o+ ALIASCHK is an alias for the ISPMODE session control code 5,
        Check Aliases.  This is available in the MEMLIST dialog.

    `o+ The APPEND operand in OFFLOAD will tack on members to the
        sequential output dataset.

    `o+ The first operand after the file/member specification
        in a SuperC COMPARE can be BYTE, FILE, or WORD to change
        the compare type (from the LINE default).

       `e.g.+
          compare member1 member2 byte
          compare 'file1' 'file2' file

    `o+ The first operand after the file/member specification
        in a SuperC COMPARE can be YALE, in which case the Yale
        TSO COMPARE program, COMPARE$ will be invoked in lieu of
        SuperC COMPARE.

       `e.g.+
          compare member1 member2 yale

    `o+ > will CHANGE to the last dsname used in a COPY subcommand.

    `o+ PTSEXP: if member name is ALL, then all members of the input
        PDS will be expanded to members of an output PDS.

    `o+ MODEL is a user-extensible primary command in panel P86OPUX.

        This command is used to allocate a new dataset (PDS, PDSE, or
        PS) using the characteristics of the active dataset.

        A popup prompt is provided with all of the current allocation
        information allowing all allocation parameters to be changed.

        The Dataset name must be changed to a new dataset name before
        proceeding.  The Volser field can be blanked out and STORCLAS
        can be specified to allow SMS allocation to manage the target
        location.

    `o+ The &&MSSTART variable determines which of the three MEMLIST
        source panels is displayed first.

        2 = P86PN6PS  (TTR)
        3 = P86PNSPS  (LONG DATE)

    `o+ The &&MLSTART variable determines which of the three MEMLIST
        load panels is displayed first.

        1 = P86PN7PS  (LKED DATE, ATTRIBUTES)
        2 = P86PN8PS  (TTR, LENGTH, ENTRY, SSI)
        3 = P86PNDPS  (LKED DATE, ATTRIBUTES, TTR, LENGTH, ENTRY, SSI)

    `o+ The &&LFSTART variable determines which of the three LISTF
        panels is displayed first.

        1 = P86PNKPS  (DSORG, RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE, SHORT DSNAME)
        2 = P86PNLPS  (DSORG, RECFM, LONG DSNAME)
        3 = P86PNMPS  (CREATE/REF DATES, SIZE, EXTENTS, UPDATE INDICATOR)

    `o+ The &&LVSTART variable determines which of the three LISTV
        panels is displayed first.

        1 = P86PNHPS  (TOTAL FREE, LARGEST EXTENT)
        2 = P86PNIPS  (VTOC LOCATION/SIZE)
        3 = P86PNRPS  (SPACE USED PCT)

    `o+ There is more (see $$$UNDOC and #PDSMODS), you have to explore.
