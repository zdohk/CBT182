Steps 1,2 should be run on your z/OS big iron system.
Steps 3,4 should be run on your MVS 3.8J Hercules emulation system.

1.  To generate a version of PDS v8.6 that will run on MVS 3.8J
under the Hercules emulator use the following options in #PDSGEN or
#PDSGENU.
********************************************************************

&NLMA    SETC  ''            *** NULLIFY THE LMA     SUBCOMMAND
&NCOB    SETC  ''            *** NULLIFY THE COBANAL SUBCOMMAND
&NCPK    SETC  ''            *** NULLIFY THE CPKMAP  SUBCOMMAND

&NVPE    SETC  ''            *** NULLIFY THE VPDSE   SUBCOMMAND

2.  Linkedit PDS86 with AC=1 and remove the RENT,REUS,REFR options from
the linkage editor parms.  When running IEBCOPY (COPY and COMPRESS) in
PDS v8.6 under MVS 3.8J, dynamic allocation tries to store a character
in a "read-only" text unit parameter, and creates a 0C4 abend which
violates reentrancy.

3.  Authorization is req'd to invoke IEBCOPY under MVS 3.8.  Add PDS (an
alias to PDS86) as an entry in csect IKJEFTE2 of load module IKJEFT02
in SYS1.LPALIB.  If you are running Volker Bandke's MVS Turnkey system,
then PDS is already defined in IKJEFT02.  If you have to zap IKJEFT02
with the PDS command name, then re-IPL with the CLPA option.

4.  Copy PDS86 and its alias PDS, to an authorized library such as
SYS2.CMDLIB in the MVS 3.8 system.
