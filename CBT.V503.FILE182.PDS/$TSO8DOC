Support 8-Character TSO userids in the following control blocks
with z/OS 2.3.

  TSVT, TPVT, UPT, and PSCB.

Changes involved extracting the TSO prefix for the dynamic
allocation of unqualified output datasets and the extraction of the
TSO userid, both of which can be 7 or 8 characters in length.

Modules changed:

  #MDSECT  @ATTRIB  @COPY    @DIAOUT  @LIST    @MATCH
  @OFFLOAD @PARSE   @PDSMAIN @PTSEXP  @SEPARAT @SMPGEN
  @SUBS
