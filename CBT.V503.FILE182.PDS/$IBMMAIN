Subject:   PDS Command - 40 Years Old

The PDS command is still running today in the z/OS environment.  Tom
Springer, Steve Smith, and William Finkelstein were the original authors 40
years ago when they worked together at Security Pacific National Bank.
Bruce Leland and Steve Smith took the PDS command to a new level after
developing the StarToolÂ® vendor product.  And Sam Golob (Mr CBT) deserves a
lot of credit for publishing numerous articles about how to use the PDS
command.

I would like to thank these contributors, whose efforts made this software
what it is.  These people have helped by writing code and documentation, by
testing, by giving SHARE presentations, and by suggesting new function
enhancements.
