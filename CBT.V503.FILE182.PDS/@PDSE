 DC C'PDSE Structure:                                                 '
 DC C'                                                                '
 DC C'The limit for the number of members in a PDSE directory is      '
 DC C'522,236. The PDSE directory is expandable; you can keep adding  '
 DC C'entries up to the directory size limit or until the data set    '
 DC C'runs out of space.  The PDSE directory can extend into          '
 DC C'secondary space.                                                '
 DC C'                                                                '
 DC C'The PDSE directory is indexed, permitting more direct searches  '
 DC C'for members.  The name and the relative track address of a      '
 DC C'member are used as keys to search for members.  For PDSE        '
 DC C'members, the TTRs are not relative track and record numbers but '
 DC C'rather pseudo randomly generated aliases for the PDSE member.   '
 DC C'                                                                '
 DC C'The PDSE directory contains keys (member names) in a compressed '
 DC C'format.  The insertion or deletion of new keys may cause the    '
 DC C'compression of other directory keys to change.                  '
 DC C'                                                                '
 DC C'A PDSE member is allocated in full page increments. A member is '
 DC C'maintained on full page boundaries, and any remaining space in  '
 DC C'the page is unused.  PDSE members can contain a maximum number  '
 DC C'of 15,728,639 logical records.                                  '
 DC C'                                                                '
 DC C'A PDSE can have up to 123 extents.  A PDSE cannot extend beyond '
 DC C'one volume.  A PDSE uses a physical block size of 4 KB, the same'
 DC C'size as an MVS page.                                            '
