%Introduction:+

 In this book, we will introduce some basic concepts to new users of the
 PDS TSO command processor.  The evolution of the PDS dataset format began
 with the early IBM operating systems in the mid-1960's.  A Partitioned Data
 Set (PDS) consists of a directory and members.  This concept is similar to
 a Unix file directory.  The members are sequential data sets terminated
 by an End of File (EOF) marker and pointed to by an entry in the
 alphabetically organized directory.

 With the advent of OS/360, IBM batch utility programs were available
 to update and organize a PDS. When TSO was introduced in 1971,
 users were able to access files using an interactive time-sharing
 environment with IBM 3270 Display System terminals.  In today's world,
 these 3270 green screens have been replaced with emulator software in
 the PC environment.  TSO command processors format data streams that are
 sent to and received from a 3270 terminal.

 In 1972, programmers¹ from Security Pacific National Bank wrote the PDS
 command processor to enable the manipulation of PDS directories and data.
 The first version of the PDS command had 12 subcommands and operated
 in TSO line mode.  The current version has over 65 subcommands and can
 operate in TSO line or ISPF dialog (ISPMODE) mode.

%Invoking PDS for the first time:+

 When you invoke PDS in dialog mode from the PDS Primary Menu or from
 ISPF DSLIST, the first display is the%Session Log.+  Unlike ISPF Edit,
 there is no member list displayed, so it may seem like something
 is missing.

 For new users, we suggest you become familiar with the drop-down lists on
 each function display.  The majority of the function control commands
 are in the lists.

 To begin, enter a%ML :+dialog command in the Session Log display.
 This will display all members of the PDS in the MEMLIST dialog function.
 To return to the Session Log, View Log can be selected from the Function
 or Special drop-down lists or just enter%8.+  To return back to the
 MEMLIST display, enter%ML.+

 MEMLIST displays can also be generated by using the MEMLIST drop down list
 in the Session Log screen.  You can build a MEMLIST based on when the
 members were last updated.  Building a MEMLIST based on the last update
 is what will become standard practice as you become a PDS Master.

 Once the member list is displayed, you may be thinking, what do I do now?
 You can enter a PDS subcommand at the PDS command prompt or you can enter
 a PDS line command.


%Subcommand Prompting Panels:+

 Enter an%O+in the Command area and you will see a screen full of
 subcommands that can be executed.  Enter an%O+in the line command area
 left of the member name and you will see another screen full of
 subcommands that can be executed for that member.

 After subcommands are executed, you will see the results in the Session
 Log.  The log output can be written to a dataset or SYSOUT file
 at any time.

 Tip:  There are 9 Session Logs that can be written to in PDS.
 "SHOW n" will switch to logs 1-9.  The default is log 1.


%Member Groups:+

 When entering most subcommands in the command field, you have to
 specify a "member group" to be acted upon.

 These subcommands can have a "member group" specification:

¢AMBLIST  ATTRIB   BROWSE   COBANAL  COPY     DCF      DELETE   DIRENTRY
 DSPRINT  EDIT     FIND     FSE      HISTORY  IF       LIST     LMA
 MAP      MEMBERS  MEMLIST  OFFLOAD  OUTCOPY  PRINTOFF REPLACE  REPRO
 REVIEW   SMPGEN   SRCHFOR  SUBLIST  SUBMIT   TSOEDIT  TSOLIST  VERIFY
 VIEW     VPSPRINT XMIT
+
 Member groups in PDS can be a difficult subject to learn, but they also
 enable actions on a variety of members with a single subcommand.  This is
 what makes the PDS command so powerful.

 There is a lot of documentation  about member groups in the ISPF tutorials
 and the PDS TSO Help member, but here are some examples to get you started.


 Member Group      Member Result Set

%:+                all member names in the PDS (same as a:z)
%a:c+              all member names that start with "a" or "b" or "c"
%p86/+             all members with "p86" anywhere in the name
%pdshelp+          member PDSHELP (one member)
%*+                current member group (last member group specified)
%(m$: #: @:)+      all member names that start with "m$", "#", and "@"

 A parenthesized list containing member and member group specifications
 separated by commas may be used as demonstrated in the example above.


%MEMLIST and SUBLIST:+

 By design, MEMLIST is cumulative.  Each MEMLIST command or THEN(MEMLIST
 will add rows to the memlist table.  The member names are not saved in
 memory by the PDS command; they are saved as rows in an ISPF table.
 You can manually add the RESET operand to any MEMLIST command to clear
 the table before adding to it.  The NEWML operand of FIND/IF THEN/ELSE
 also clears the table before adding new rows.

 You can enter "2" or  X ALL" to clear the table.  The table is set to
 empty status, but the member group does not change.

 SUBLIST is used to define a new member group, so by definition it is not
 cumulative.  You can make it cumulative if you run a series of commands
 like below (* is the current member group designation).

 find : 'string' then(sublist
 sublist (* pan/ exec/ tbl/)
 sublist (* mbr1, mbr2, mbr3)
 members *


%ISPMODE session control codes are as follows:+

  %1+- Suspend ISPMODE: this control code terminates ISPMODE,
       retains the session log and enters line mode processing.
       ISPMODE can be restarted using the previous session log
       with another ISPMODE subcommand.  At the end of PDS
       processing, the session log is always discarded.

       Note:  XISPMODE is an alias for this control code.

  %2+- Clear log: discards all lines of the session log.

  %4+- Sublist = Memlist:  creates a sublist from the entries
       in the member list display.  This also sets the current
       group, which is addressable by using "*" in a subsequent
       subcommand.

  %5+- Alias check: performs a validity check for all aliases
       in the directory.

  %6+- MEMLIST (all members): invokes a scrollable member list
       for all members.  PDS line commands can be entered on
       individual member lines.

  %7+- Output ISPMODE table: invokes a panel which prompts for
       a SYSOUT class or data set name which is to contain a
       copy of the ISPMODE table.

  %8+- View log: switch to the Session Log display.

       Note:  SHOW is an alias for this control code.

  %9+- Swap panels (Norm--> Alt--> Dual):  most function displays
       have 3 different panels.  Each "9" entry will cycle through
       the different panels.  This can also be accomplished with
       PF10 (Left) and PF11 (Right) function keys if your Sysprog
       has set this up in the ISPF command table.

  %L+- Locate: locate name in table display.

  %F+- Find in table: find string in the table display.
       This is not the same as the FIND subcommand which can be
       abbreviated as FI or FIN.

  %X+- Exclude lines: to delete portions of a dialog display.

       X ABOVE or UP    -  delete all lines above the current line
       X BELOW or DOWN  -  delete all lines below the current line
       X ALL            -  delete all lines
       X -nnn           -  delete nnn lines above the current line
       X nnn            -  delete nnn lines below the current line

%SORT+- Sort table: sort table by column; ascending or descending
        sequence.  Column headers that are point-and-shoot can be
        clicked on to sort in both directions.

  %FN+- ISPMODE function selection:

        FUNCTION - Display function status
        SHOW     - View log prompt
        8        - View log
        MEMLIST  - Member list  (ML for short)
        LISTA    - List allocation prompt
        LISTC    - List file prompt
        LISTF    - List file prompt
        LISTV    - List volume prompt
        LA       - Switch to LISTA display
        LC       - Switch to LISTC/LISTF display
        LF       - Switch to LISTC/LISTF display
        LV       - Switch to LISTV display
        CAX      - Switch to CAX display  (Active catalog list)
        TCT      - Switch to TCT display  (TSO command table)

    Note:

   %fn.lista+can be used to jump to list allocation prompt
   %fn.listc+can be used to jump to list file prompt
   %fn.listf+can be used to jump to list file prompt
   %fn.listv+can be used to jump to list volume prompt

  %FU+- ISPMODE function status display:

        Option     Function     -- Description --     ---- Status -----
          8      - View Log     View session log       ACTIVE
          ML     - MEMLIST      Member list            ACTIVE
          LA     - LISTA        Allocation list        INACTIVE
          LF     - LISTF        File list              INACTIVE
          LV     - LISTV        Volume list            INACTIVE
          CAX    - CAX          Active catalog list    INACTIVE
          TCT    - TCT          TSO command table      INACTIVE

 %SET+- ISPMODE set defaults:

        SETENV   - Set default environmental options
        SETSEL   - Set default select alias commands
        SETLOG   - Set default Log limit values
        SETML    - Set default member list options
        SETV     - Set default LISTV options
        SETLF    - Set default LISTFILE/LISTC options
        SETTRAP  - Set default TRAP options
