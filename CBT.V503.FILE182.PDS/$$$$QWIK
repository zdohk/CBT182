 Choose either Option A or B for a QWIK install...
 Choose Option C for a SMP install...


 Option A:


 Lionel Dyck has created a PDSQINST exec that does a quick install
 for most of the steps below listed in the "Traditional" quick install.

 PDS load modules, pre-assembled/linked by CBT Proprietor Sam Golob,
 are used (Z035XMIT and UTILXMIT) in this process.

 1. Run exec PDSQINST to create new panel, message, and load libraries.
    The load library will contain the new version of PDS and various
    utility programs used by PDS.

 2. Answer some questions to define the HLQ and if you want a set of
    ISPF panels that support point and shoot. Answer a question about
    which compare utility to use.

      Y - COMPARE$ - Yale TSO COMPARE program
      C - COMPAREW - COMPAREX compare program

 3. Run exec PDS86X to launch the new version of PDS.


 Option B:

 "Traditional" quick install instructions:

 This method skips some customization steps but you can do those later
 if you need to.  Member $$$INST has the original install instructions.

 1.  Modify JCL and submit member PDSJCLHL to assemble and link PDS
     into a task library.

 2.  Modify JCL and submit member PDSPJCL to copy ISPF panels and
     message member.  And optionally, some rexx execs.

 3.  RECEIVE INDS(installation.pds(UTILXMIT)) to receive external
     commands and programs used by PDS into a task library.

 4.  Copy PDSHELP member to a SYSHELP library as member PDS86
     and reestablish aliases if any existed (e.g., PDS, PDSE).

 5.  Add this option to the ISPF Primary Option Menu if the PDS
     libraries are in the logon proc or startup clist.

    )AREA
     . . .
     P  PDS Command   Invoke the PDS command processor

    )PROC
      . . .
      P,'PANEL(PDS@PRIM) SCRNAME(PDS)'

 6.  Add panel and message libraries to ISPPLIB and ISPMLIB
     concatenations.

 *** External commands and programs must be available via a tasklib.
     Use the the IBM TSOLIB command, CBT STEPLIB command, or add
     library to STEPLIB or Linklist dataset concatenation.


 Option C:

 SMP install instructions:

 This method uses SMP to install PDS into the target and dlib datasets.

 1.  SMP jobs to install the PDS command package.

     SMPALLOC -- Allocate SMP datasets
     SMPCSI   -- Allocate SMP CSI and add zones
     SMPDDDEF -- Add SMP DDDEF entries
     SMPRECV  -- Receive the PDS command package
     SMPAPPLY -- Apply the PDS command package
     SMPACCPT -- Accept the PDS command package

 2.  Edit SET symbols in the jobs above with your naming conventions.

 3.  Submit jobs in the order listed above.

 4.  RECEIVE INDS(installation.pds(UTILXMIT)) to receive external
     commands and programs used by PDS into a task library.

 5.  Copy PDSHELP member to a SYSHELP library as member PDS86
     and reestablish aliases if any existed (e.g., PDS, PDSE).

 6.  Add this option to the ISPF Primary Option Menu if the PDS
     libraries are in the logon proc or startup clist.

    )AREA
     . . .
     P  PDS Command   Invoke the PDS command processor

    )PROC
      . . .
      P,'PANEL(PDS@PRIM) SCRNAME(PDS)'

 7.  Add panel and message libraries to ISPPLIB and ISPMLIB
     concatenations.

 *** External commands and programs must be available via a tasklib.
     Use the the IBM TSOLIB command, CBT STEPLIB command, or add
     library to STEPLIB or Linklist dataset concatenation.
