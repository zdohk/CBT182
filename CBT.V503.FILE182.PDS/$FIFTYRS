ST LOUIS, March 20, 2022 (UNDERDOGÂ® NEWSWIRE) -

The PDS command that runs on the latest z/OS operating system today
was developed five decades ago on the OS/360 operating system.

Tom Springer, Steve Smith and William Finkelstein were the original
authors in 1972 when they worked together at Security Pacific National
Bank.

During the next twenty years, Bruce Leland and Steve Smith changed the
landscape of the PDS command by adding a vast number of new subcommands
and ISPF dialog functions.  All of which, is written in reentrant
assembly language.

After a decade of dormancy, PDS was enhanced to support Year 2000
dates, CUA panel design, Partitioned Data Set Extended (Greg Price),
ISPF extended statistics, PDSE datasets in cylinder-managed space
(John Hamlet), 8-character TSO userids, and new subcommands with
interfaces to standard utility programs.
