>8-Character TSO User IDs

o  In V2R3, z/OS will support the expansion of the TSO user ID
   from a maximum of 7 characters to a maximum of 8 characters.

o  No other change to rules on character composition of user IDs.

o  z/OS will provide a switch to enable an installation to request
   that 8-character user IDs be allowed.

o  Initially, the default will be to maintain the 7-character maximum,
   changing in the future to allow the 8-character maximum,
   and eventually having the 8-character maximum become the standard.

   Note:  See $TSO8* members for PDS implementation of this change.


>PDS859E COMMAND IKJEFTSR WAS NOT FOUND

LPD search code in PDSMAIN was failing for link pack modules because
of a LPD entry size increase (40 to 48) in z/OS 2.3.  Not being a
programming interface, LPD search code was replaced with a LOAD macro
(based on the advice from Greg Price; of REVIEW fame).
