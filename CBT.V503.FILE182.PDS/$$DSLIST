Note:  The command table addition below is no longer required.
       This is optional after the DRK JUN07 update to PDSMAIN.
       TSO PDS 'dsname' from the command line in ISPF DSLIST
       should work as expected (use the cataloged dsname).

If &DSLIST is set to 'YES' (use VOLSER from 3.4 DSLIST table),
then add the command below to your USER/SITE/SYSTEM
ISPF command table.

This will enable you to issue a PDS 'dsname' from the command
line in ISPF DSLIST without the &ZDLVOL substitution.
