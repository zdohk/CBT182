Introduction:
  This application supports PDSE V2 member generations and is based on
  the full function Lionel B. Dyck PDSEGEN dialog.  PGLITE is a simpler
  version, or subset, of PDSEGEN.

  This table application demonstrates the use of ISPF Dynamic Areas.
  Benchmark tests have shown dynamic area tables can be up to 5x faster
  than ISPF tables.

  This dialog is self-contained.  All the panels, execs, and object text
  are included in the driver exec, PGLITE.

  TSO Help format in member PGHXMIT.

  Local site customization values on lines with

     <<=== MODIFY

  Create DESERV interface module (PDSEGENI) with

  1. TSO %PGLITE >PDSEGENI
           -or-
  2. TSO SUBMIT the PGLITE member
           -or-
  3. Install SMP usermod (member SMPUMOD3)

Tips:
  When invoking PDSEGEN via the BIG primary command, you can stack
  a PDSEGEN primary command by using the ISPF command delimiter, the
  semicolon.  For example,

    BIG filter;Dataset Command

  Dataset Commands:
      BACkup   RESTore   COPy   MODel   Prune

PDSEGEN Backup Dataset Notes:
  Edit and View on a PDSEGEN backup member (@000000n) will fire the
  GNAME Edit macro to display the real member name and generation
  number in a NOTELINE.  The REAL command will display the real
  member names and generations in the GenNum and Created columns of
  the member list display.

Optional Edit panel modification:
<ISREDDE2 mod to display Gen: number in title>
/*  Add to end of )INIT section  */
IF (&gen = '')
ELSE
   IF (&zmemb ¬= ' ') &ztitle =  '&zdsn(&zmemb) Gen: &gen'
   IF (&zmemb  = ' ') &ztitle =  '&zdsn'
</ISREDDE2 mod>
