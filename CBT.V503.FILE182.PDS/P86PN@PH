  ¢PDS+is a TSO command for Partitioned Data Sets and Partitioned Data
   Sets Extended (PDSE's).  You can control¢PDS+with subcommands which
   manipulate the entire partitioned data set or process individual
   partitioned data set members.

   Any of the following entry modes may be selected on the initial panel:
    %I+- Enter with ISPMODE initialization.
    %M+- Enter with MEMLIST initialization using the%MEMBERS+specification:
          -- for all members, use the default of * for MEMBERS
          -- for members between A4 and BCD99999, enter A4:BCD for MEMBERS
          -- for members between P86 and P8699999, enter P86* for MEMBERS
          -- for members whose names contain PDS82, enter PDS82/ for MEMBERS
    %L+- Enter using line mode terminal output.
    %blank+- Enter with MEMLIST initialization unless no member entry is
             given; in which case, ISPMODE initialization will be performed.
