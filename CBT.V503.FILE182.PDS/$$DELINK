DLINK is a PDS interface to David Noon's DELINKI program via
the TSO/E Service Facility Routine, IKJEFTSR.

Currently, this interface will process only one load module
at a time (i.e., no member groups are allowed).

For example:
  DLINK PDS86              Delink PDS86 to object deck format

Note:  The &NDLN global variable is set to DLINK instead of
of DELINK so you don't inadvertently DELete a module.

Return code:
  8 - Load module not found
