This member documents changes to support the PDSMAN product:


PDS logic was changed to test for PDSMAN directory entries for the
following commands:
    ATTRIB listing APF level or SSI information
    ATTRIB with AUTH/NOAUTH change
    ATTRIB with SSI(hexdata)/NOSSI
    IF testing for AUTH/NOAUTH
    IF testing for APFERR/NOAPFERR
    IF testing for SSI/NOSSI/SSI(hexdata)
    MAP with JCL operand to determine APF and SSI
    RESTORE with LIKE operand to determine APF and SSI


Specific PDS support was added for PDSMAN directory entries for the
following commands:
    ATTRIB information listing for PDSMAN members
    DIRENTRY information listing for PDSMAN members


Please test the following PDS functions in a small PDSMAN controlled
test load library:
    ATTRIB for alias and nonalias members (note PDSMAN messages)
    DIRENTRY for alias and nonalias members (note PDSMAN messages)
    MEMLIST for alias and nonalias members (note APF byte)
    OPTION 5 on a MEMLIST panel
    ATTRIB with AUTH/NOAUTH keyword for alias and nonalias members
    IF testing with AUTH/NOAUTH keyword for the above
    ATTRIB with SSI(hexdata)/NOSSI for alias and nonalias members
    IF testing with SSI/NOSSI/SSI(hexdata) keyword for the above
    ALIAS XYZ ABC (where XYZ is a main member)
    RENAME XYZ ZZZ
    RENAME ABC CCC
    MAP with JCL keyword for alias and nonalias members
    VERIFY :


FIXPDS note:
    In order for FIXPDS EXPANDDIR or FREEDIR to work correctly in a
    PDSMAN environment, you must delete the space management member
    ($$$SPACE) before expanding the directory.  PDSMAN will re-establish
    the $$$SPACE member the next time you compress the PDS.

    To expand the directory perform the following PDS subcommands:
    1. DELETE $$$SPACE     (remove the PDSMAN control member)
    2. FIXPDS EXPANDDIR... (expand the directory as desired)
    3. COMPRESS            (compress to resume PDSMAN monitoring)

Problem Description
TITLE: PM74421 CORRUPTION AFTER SE37
*=======================================================================

* EZYEDIT Member delete corrupts DS1LSTAR

*=======================================================================

Deleting a PDS member, from EZYEDIT's Member List display, can corrupt
the DS1LSTAR field of DSCB (in VTOC). Once DS1LSTAR is corrupted, any
subsequent update may cause further corruption as members near the
directory are overlaid.

For the corruption to occur, all of the following must occur:

- some update to PDS results in a SE37-04 condition which leaves
DS1LSTAR in an invalid state which references a TTR that is outside
the PDS' physical end. Not all SE37 failures will result in a bad
DS1LSTAR.

- EZYEDIT Member List is used to delete a member from this same PDS.
At this point, no member data has been corrupted, only DS1LSTAR
is corrupt. If PDS is compressed at this point, DS1LSTAR will be
corrected and no member data will be corrupted.

- Any update to PDS, which adds a new member or updates an existing
member, will write new data at the TTR in corrupted DS1LSTAR. At this
point, member data has been corrupted, and will continue to be
corrupted further, until DS1LSTAR field is corrected. It does not
matter what method or utility is used to do update.

The DS1LSTAR corruption occurs because invalid data is left in DCB
as EZYEDIT switches from Input to Output mode. The invalid data causes
CLOSE processing to update DSCB (in VTOC) with a corrupted DS1LSTAR
value.

The corruption will start within or near the directory because the TT of
the TTR value in DS1LSTAR, is forced to be x'0000'. This leaves DS1LSTAR
set somewhere in the first track.

Apar PM74421 clears the left-over data from DCB before switch to Output
mode, which inturn, causes CLOSE processing to leave DS1LSTAR as it
was prior to member delete.
