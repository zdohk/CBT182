In z/OS 1.9, Program Management Binder Fast Data Access service
uses memory above the bar (64 bit).

ATTRIB, HISTORY, MAP, and MEMLIST use this service for PDSE's.

Assure that MEMLIMIT is set to a value higher than your largest
program object, otherwise you will get the following error message:

IEW2091S IEWBFDAT UNABLE TO GET n MB OF 64-BIT STORAGE, IARV64 CODE x

If MEMLIMIT is not specified, SMF provides a default value. The IEFUSI
installation exit can override any JCL- or SMF-supplied value.
