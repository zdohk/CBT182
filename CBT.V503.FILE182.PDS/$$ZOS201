Problem:

For PDSE files, ATTRIB, HISTORY, and MAP get ABEND S378-14 when PDS was
assembled under z/OS 2.1 because of DESERV macro error.

                  ----------

The DESERV macro error was introduced with the development of PDSE
Version 2, giving support for multiple copies of a single member.  This
was partially introduced in PTF UA71462, and the error persisted through
PUT Level 1505, PTF UA77137 as indicated below.  So if you are
assembling the PDS 8.6 program, and you have DESERV between these
two levels, then you must make a copy of the DESERV macro, make the
change indicated below, and assemble with that version concatenated
ahead of SYS1.MACLIB.

DESERV was fixed and corrects the problem below, at the PUT Level 1505.

Fixes are:  For z/OS 2.1 - UA77137  (PUT 1505)   Apar OA47634
                  prereq - UA76820  (PUT 1504)   Apar OA45505

            Assembling PDS with DESERV macro at this level will
            fix the problem.  Otherwise, modify the DESERV macro
            with the logic below (make a copy of it to modify).
*---->                         ---                               <----*

Solution:

Change DESERV macro as described below and put in front of SYS1.MACLIB
in SYSLIB concatenation on assembly steps.  Or wait for IBM to fix macro.

<The fix below was supplied by mainframe1960@gmail.com>

"The AIF instruction that checks (('&FUNC' EQ 'GET') AND
('&FUNC' EQ 'GET_G')) should be  (('&FUNC' EQ 'GET') OR
('&FUNC' EQ 'GET_G')).  The second condition (GET_G) was added in
z/OS 2.1 (FMID HDZ2210, RMID UA71462 on SYS9)."


Problem:

IEC190I OPEN DCBE validation message after invoking the PDS command.
OPEN is successful and the PDS can be accessed.

  IEC190I MFHDAG0,ATSOPROC.ATSOPROC,SYS00030 INVALID DCBE: EXCP DCB
  WITHOUT FOUNDATION EXT

Solution:

z/OS 2.1 maintenance to fix this problem.
