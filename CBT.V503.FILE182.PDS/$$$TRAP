                  PDS DIALOG TRAP SERVICE

   The PDS Dialog Trap service provides for trapping TSO
   command output and placing it in the session View Log.
   This service can be used by TCT and from P86..UX panels.

   This service uses the TSO/E SYSOUTTRAP service.  This
   service requires both ISPF 2.3 and TSO/E and the
   installation of the PDSTRAP clist.  Tt is recommended that
   if possible to use this feature.  If ISPF 2.3 (or higher)
   is not installed this feature will be ignored even if TRAP
   is set to YES.  If this feature is not active, output from
   a TSO command requested with the TRAP option will operate
   without trapping the output, the output will go directly to
   the users screen in the normal way.  This option can be set
   by the individual user through the PDS SETTRAP dialog command.

   To use this service first install the PDSTRAP clist into one
   of the installation clist libraries that is included in the
   SYSPROC DD concatenation.  The PDSTRAP clist is in FB-80 format
   but can be copied using ISPF option 3.3 into ether a FB-80 or
   VB-255 format library.

** NOTE:  If you are running with the &LOGWIDE global variable
   set to YES, then COPY the PDSTRAPW clist as PDSTRAP into
   your SYSPROC concatenation and update the PDSTRAPT test
   clist with the proper variable and panel names (see comments
   in clist).
