In z/OS 1.13, a new utility, IEBPDSE, will be designed to verify that
the structure PDSE is valid, and new programming services will be
designed to perform similar checking to help programs verify the state
of a PDSE before and after critical operations. These new functions are
intended to help you detect errors in PDSE structures that might
otherwise go undetected.

The PDS subcommand VPDSE will call IEBPDSE via the TSO/E Service
Facility Routine, IKJEFTSR.
