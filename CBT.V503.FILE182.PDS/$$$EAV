Update 8.6.14.6:

Issue:  DS1LSTAR was set to zero after a FIXPDS ADDCYLS(nnn) generated
an E37-04 abend.  This corruption by EOV happens when using a DCBE for
a regular PDS.

Status:  IBM is aware of this problem, but no PMR has been submitted.

Temporary fix:  FIXPDS was changed to only use a DCBE if processing a
Format 8 DSCB.

Update 8.6.14.4:

EAV support for PDSE data sets allocated in the cylinder-managed
space.  This mod thanks to John Hamlet from SAS.

Update 8.6.14.1:

LISTV: Expand cylinder display fields (largest, total, and primary) to 7
characters and identify 3390-A volumes.  This change was made to
accommodate 1TB EAV drives.

Two ideas for future LISTV panel updates:

1. The maximum cylinders possible on EAV is 268,434,453.  The TRK and
ALT fields could be dropped so there is room to display 9 positions
of CYLinder data on the screen.

2. CYLinders could be displayed in M(illion) units if the value is over
9,999,999 and keep the TRK and ALT fields.  Similar to USE CNT (99K).
