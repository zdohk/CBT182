Support for UCB Services (dynamic UCBs), UCB VSCR (>16mb UCBs),
and 4digit device numbers has been added via the UCBSCAN, EDTINFO,
and UCBDEVN macros.

The &MVSLEV global variable and the CVTOSLV1 storage field are
used to determine which functions are available on your system.

&MVSLEV (set in #PDSGEN/U):

  MVS410 and higher - UCB Services (DYNAMIC=YES UCBs)
  MVS510 and higher - 4digit device numbers

CVTOSLV1 (CVT + x'4F1'):

  x'20' - HBB5510 functions are present (RANGE=ALL device numbers)
  x'10' - HBB5520 functions are present (LOC=ANY   UCBs)

If you are running an older MVS/ESA system (4.2.0, 4.2.2, or 4.3.0)
that has toleration support installed for RANGE=ALL and LOC=ANY usage
on the UCBSCAN and EDTINFO macros, then use a value of MVS510 or
or higher for &MVSLEV and put hard branches after the test under mask
(TM  CVTOSLV1-CVT(R15),HBB5510/20) instructions in modules @DIALALV,
@DIALINE, and @DIALOG to order to invoke the proper macro calls.

If you are running an older MVS/ESA system (4.2.0, 4.2.2, or 4.3.0)
that does not have toleration support installed, the RANGE=ALL and
LOC=ANY parameters must be removed from the UCBSCAN and EDTINFO macros
or assembly errors will result.  See APARs OW11516 and OW13662.

The &MAXDASD variable is used to determine the amount of storage to
GETMAIN for the EDTINFO RTNDEVN (return device number list).  This
list is used when processing the LISTV xxxxxxxx GENERIC command.
The default of 4094 devices (4094*4+8) results in a 16K storage request.
