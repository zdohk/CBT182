First SHARE:

My boss (Joe Polster, RIP) and I went to New Orleans for SHARE in August
1982.  For some strange reason, I thought IBM was synonymous with suits
so I brought 2 suits.  Needless to say, after the first day I wore jeans
for the rest of the week.

The registration fee at SHARE was only $120.  The fee only covered
drinks at SCIDS and the conference facilities.

SCIDS was at the Marriott in an open ballroom where most everyone stood
around in small circles; drinking, smoking, and talking.  A spent drink
cup was placed on the floor in the center of the circle and was used as
an ash tray.  Being in New Orleans, there was a natural transition to
Bourbon Street after attending SCIDS.  I remember eating at a couple of
places on Bourbon Street.  Ralph and Kakoo's (where Mike Anderson's is
now located), and Houlihan's (where Rick's gentleman's club is now
located).  This was my first trip to the Big Easy and I was surprised
when seeing the French Quarter for the first time.  I knew it was not
like anything else I had ever seen.

At our shop we were running MVT 21.8F with the ITEL 3330 mods (a rigged
version of MVT with some VS1 code) and planning the conversion to
MVS/SP.  We did not run HASP under MVT.  We used the MVT RDR's and
WTR's.  All of our production reports were spooled to tape and processed
by a special print driver program called D05PTPCH.  So, the SHARE
sessions on JES2 were particularly valuable to me.

3380 DASD was just introduced and Candle Corp (Marty Sprinzen) gave a
presentation on the performance advantages of these new drives.

I remember attending a session on automated operations.  I think it
involved using some SPF panels and SDSF.

I can't say for sure, but I think I first found out about the CBT tape
at SHARE.  I didn't find out about the PDS command until 1985.  We were
using PDS4 at the time.  In 1986, I found out about the ISPF dialog mode
of PDS (version 7.3).  PDS is the cat's meow, and I have been using it
ever since.

If you ever get a chance to go to SHARE, do not pass up the opportunity.

John K
