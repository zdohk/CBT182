CPKMAP is a PDS interface to the Innovation DP Compaktor map
program via the TSO/E Service Facility Routine, IKJEFTSR.

For example:
  CPKMAP SYSRES       Display track map of volume SYSRES
  CPKMAP *            Display track map of currently allocated volume

Abend codes:
  U=0502 - Invalid volume on control statement

Note: CBT 792 DISKMAP is an alternative track mapping program.  See
member $DISKMAP for more information.

The use of the FDRCPK program from Innovation by the CPKMAP subcommand
requires that it be defined in the IKJTSOxx PARMLIB member under the
AUTHTSF section.  Issue operator command {SET|T} IKJTSO=xx to activate.

It must also reside in an authorized library that is available to your
TSO session.
