   According to$IBM+standards, member names should begin with an
   alphabetic or national character and it may be followed with up to
   seven alphanumeric or national characters.

   Member names with lower-case characters can be entered in hex.

      ZONE  888888888999999999AAAAAAAA
      DIGIT 12345678912345678923456789

   To allow specification of lower-case member names,¢PDS+allows you to
   enter hexadecimal member names.  Note the following examples for a
   data set containing members named a, aD, a1, a2, b2, z299, Ba, and
   BaDZ:

+    MEMBERS%x'81':x'81'      + (would match members a, aD, a1 and a2)
+    MEMBERS%x'81'/           + (would match members a, aD, a1, a2, Ba and BaDZ)
+    MEMBERS%x'8140'/         + (would match members a and Ba)
+    MEMBERS%x'81':B          + (would match all members)
