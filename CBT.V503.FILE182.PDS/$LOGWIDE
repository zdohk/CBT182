Consider the following scenario:

1.  The &LOGWIDE SETC 'YES' global variable was coded in #PDSGENx.
2.  The P86PN1W wide panel is the current panelid.
3.  Option 7 (Output Log) is entered to write the log table to a new dataset.

PDS will allocate the output dataset with LRECL=160 and BLKSIZE=0 (SDB).
Sometimes SMS will override the LRECL depending on the low-level qualifier and
message "Data set open error - This data set could not be opened" will be
displayed.

To work around this error, use a low-level qualifier that SMS does not
recognize.  For example, XJCL instead of JCL.
