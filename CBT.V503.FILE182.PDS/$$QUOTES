While I am not a fan of the CBT tape, I guess it
serves a purpose. However why re-invent the wheel?
The rename with alias option is provided by IBM.
Why go to exotic lengths for something simple.

I realize that "PDS" is powerful, but alias is the
only function needed. Also it is freeware and as
they say you get what you pay for.

RENAME is supported and you can APAR
it if there is a problem.

It would be "gross neglect" to have a copy of this
tape and not investigate this product.

The PDS product at version 8.5 provides an ISPF
interface and utility value of awesome proportion.
you are advised not to pass over this file without
looking at it ..........

Subject: PDS Directory Question

The PDS 8.4 tool from the CBT site does a beautiful job of expanding a PDS
directory. I recommend it HIGHLY! You'll use the EXPANDDIR(nnn) to add nnn
directory blocks. If you're nervous about it, by all means take a FDR backup,
but I've never had it fail, in all the years I've used it. And PDS is a
WONDERFUL TOOL!!!  Saved my posterior many times over!!

I am of the od school I guess I have a super zap set up for this and it
only takes a job step before it to get the info for AMASZAP.

I also have a IEBGENER set up when I am in desperate need.
I prefer to use the tools I know, I do not trust pos or start tools
or whatever.
