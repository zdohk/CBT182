I am looking for volunteers to take over the maintenance of the PDS
command processor.  A knowledge of assembler language is required and
any knowledge of ISPF Dialog Manager would be a plus.

The command was written in 1972, and uses mostly IBM/360 assembler
instructions.  It operates unauthorized, so it will not trigger a
security event.

Please look after this command.  Thank you.

Regards,
Janko
P.S.  Special gift for the Successor Drone.

PDS code assembly:

@PDSMAIN -- PDS mainline routines (see $MAINRTN for synopsis)
@SUBS    -- PDS subcommands (ALIAS, ATTRIB, ...) via COPY statements
@PARSE   -- PDS parse and validation routines for subcommands
@DIALOG  -- PDS dialog functions (MEMLIST, ISPMODE, LISTA, LISTC,
            LISTV, CAX, TCT) via COPY statements

PDS tables:

#PDSTBL  -- PDS subcommand table (modify if subcommands added/changed)
@DIATBL  -- Dialog command table (modify if subcommands added/changed)

PDS dummy control sections:

#MDSECT  -- PDS primary GETMAIN area (WORKAREA)
#SPWRKA  -- ISPMODE and MEMLIST area (in #MDSECT via COPY)
@DIAWRK  -- ISPMODE and MEMLIST area (SPWRKC)

enhance the PDS command:

$$STRUCT -- General Register usage for PDS and @source-CSECT-Function
PDSPARSE -- PDSPARSE rexx exec to find PARSE workarea variables (#) in
            source members (@:).  See member PARSEVAR.
$$$$TEST -- TSO TEST breakpoint/equate scripts for debugging the
            PDS command
$$$$ZXDC -- z/XDC debugging commands for PDS
$$$DOC   -- Never hurts to read a short "doc"
PDSHELP  -- TSO help member for PDS
$$$PROSn -- Effective use of the TSO PDS command (part 1 & 2)
P86DUMI  -- PDS for Dummies, a good starting point
