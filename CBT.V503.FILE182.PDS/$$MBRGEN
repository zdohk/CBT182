MBRGEN is a PDS primary command extension (P86OPUX) which invokes
the Lionel B. Dyck PDSEGEN dialog.

PDSEGEN is an ISPF dialog designed to enable the ISPF user to exploit
the PDSE Member Generations capability that IBM introduced in z/OS 2.1
with the introduction of PDSE Version 2 Libraries.

A User's Guide PDF, a User's Guide ePub, a User's Guide Mobi (Kindle),
and a Reference Card are on Lionel's web site.

Bruce Koss (WFB) has given a SHARE presentation on PDSEGEN and
developed the PDSEGEN Quick Reference Card.

This dialog makes it possible to use member generations.  IBM
Library Access services are used to access member generations.

There are over 33,000 lines of Rexx code and 6,000 lines of ISPF
panel definitions in this package, and it is something that no systems
programmer can afford to be without  .......

The standard IBM ISPF/PDF dialogs (Edit, View, and Dslist) have
little or no support for member generations.  This may change in
the future because of Lionel's work and various RFE's that he has
submitted to IBM.

Line Commands:     * = Non-0 Generations Only   ** = Generation 0 Only

Short and Long forms (capitalized letter are valid abbreviations)

**  A Attrib     Change attributes (Version, Modification Level, Userid)
    B Browse     Browse the member
**  C COPy       Copy a member to another PDSE or PDS
                 Along with all generations
    D Delete     Delete a member or generation (if delete is for generation 0
                 then the member and all generations are deleted)
**  E Edit       Edit the member (Converted to View for non-0 generations)
*   G RECover    Recover a generation to a new member
    H Hide       Hide the current row
                 This only works to exclude the member from the display
                 and from being accessed using Browse/Edit/View
                 This will NOT exclude the member/gen from Backup/Restore/Copy
    I Info       Display ISPF Statistics about the member or generation
    J SUbmit     Submit the member to the internal reader
**  K Klone      Clone the member (gen 0 only)
      Clone      generations are not cloned
    M MAil       Mail the member$m1
    O or /       Display a member/generation sensitive popup of commands
*   P Promote    Promote a generation to generation 0
                 Copies a non-0 generation into generation 0 and leaves the
                 user in Edit.  If you issue Edit Save, then generation 0 will
                 be replaced.
**  Q RENSwap    Rename and swap the members and all generations
**  R REName     reName the member and all generations
    S SElect     Select the member using the default set action (B, E, V)
    T Tryit      Edit with the TRYIT Edit Macro
    U User       User command
    V View       View the member
    X EXecute    eXecute the member (REXX or CLIST)
*   Z COMpare    Compare generation 0 to non-0 generation member
    =            Repeat prior line command

Placing the cursor on a row and pressing enter will select that member.

Multiple members can be selected at the same time for some operations,
such as B, C, E, V or X.  Other selections will only allow one member
to be selected at a time (e.g. P and R).

Any line command can be used as a block command: XX/XX or X9999
For expanded commands double the 1st character to block it:  EEX/EEX
