Note - the following items are poorly documented or not documented at all:


  1.  PDS86 is an alias of the CHANGE subcommand.

  2.  SCRATCH is an alias of the DELETE subcommand.

  3.  SPFEDIT is an alias of the EDIT subcommand.

  4.  The ATTRIB subcommand has a single-line output format that is
      available for load modules; to use this format, enter SHORT as an
      ATTRIB keyword.  Note: if this format message is requested, many
      standard module checks are not performed and an incorrectly
      created or modified load module will not be detected.

  5.  TSO services: The U (Utility) option of the O command selection
      panel can be expanded to provide an interface to TSO commands
      which manipulate the data set used by PDS -- this ultimately
      formats a PDS TSO subcommand which is processed by PDS (reference
      panel P86OPUT).

  6.  ISPF and TSO services: The UT1 PDS subcommand is another
      user-expandable interface for TSO utility programs -- this
      interface can use any ISPF services (reference panel P86VUT1).

  7.  ISPF and TSO services: The UT2 PDS subcommand is a user-expandable
      interface for TSO utility programs which process a single member
      of the data set used by PDS -- this interface can also use any
      ISPF services (reference panel P86VUT2) and sample members
      beginning SCP...

  8.  The K OR KLEAR subcommand clears the screen in non-dialog mode.

  9.  The TIME subcommand displays the current date and time.

 10.  The COMPRESS subcommand has a "SHR" operand which allows
      compressing data sets which are in use.

 11.  Three subcommands in member #PDSGEN were added for installation
      use.  They use the PRINTOFF interface and they may be modified to
      invoke a TSO command or a CLIST.  They are currently defined as
      follows:
        a.  PDS subcommand DPSPRINT invokes a TSO command called DPSPRINT.
        b.  PDS subcommand PCLIST invokes a CLIST called PCLIST1.
        c.  The FINAL subcommand is currently unused.

 12.  PDS does not support Extended/Large Format, HFS,
      and VSAM datasets.

 13.  A subcommand called QUIT was added to terminate PDS.

 14.  A batch program is provided in the PDS distribution library to
      format help members.  See member helplist for the program and
      member PDSHJCL for sample assembly and execution JCL.

 15.  Panels P86PN5/6L are long date (yyyy/mm/dd) display versions
      of P86PN5/6 (MEMLIST Source Member List 1/2) panels.  To use,
      rename the long version names to P86PN5/6.

      Panels P86PN5/6LP are long date (yyyy/mm/dd) point-and-shoot
      display versions of P86PN5/6 (MEMLIST Source Member List 1/2)
      panels.  To use, rename the long version names to P86PN5/6PS.

      Note:  MEMLIST Source Member List 3 panel (P86PDS/PS) is now
      part of MEMLIST.  This is the same panel as P86PN5L/P, so you
      should not have to do the renames as undocumented above.

 16.  Special control code "2" in all dialog table displays
      is the same as "X ALL".

 17.  "V2" is another LISTC/LISTF option that will display an alternate
      VTOC operand panel.

 18.  The following 2 user commands are in P86OPUX.  For load libraries
      to see what has been zapped in the last month/quarter (or so).

        ZMONTH,'IF : CHANGED(&FROMM:&TO) THEN(MEMLIST)'
            ZM,'IF : CHANGED(&FROMM:&TO) THEN(MEMLIST)'
        ZQUART,'IF : CHANGED(&FROMQ:&TO) THEN(MEMLIST)'
            ZQ,'IF : CHANGED(&FROMQ:&TO) THEN(MEMLIST)'

 19.  Panels P86PN7/DL are long date (yyyy/mm/dd) display versions
      of P86PN7/D (MEMLIST Load Member List 1/3) panels.  To use,
      rename the long version names to P86PN7/D.

      Panels P86PN7/DLP are long date (yyyy/mm/dd) point-and-shoot
      display versions of P86PN7/D (MEMLIST Load Member List 1/3)
      panels.  To use, rename the long version names to P86PN7/DPS.

 20.  Panel P86TRANS contains a list of IBM product codes for a
      a variety of translators (compilers).  This is useful when
      viewing translator output (control translator) from the
      HISTORY subcommand.  Add the following line to P86OPUX
      to display them.

        TRANS,'PGM(ISPTUTOR) PARM(P86TRANS)'

      Thanks to Gilbert Saint-flour for compiling this list.

 21.  Non-standard PDS member names (SMP SCDS) can usually be used
      with a line command on the dialog MEMLIST table even if they
      don't pass member name validation.

        a.  memlist :
        b.  Enter a line command (list, edit, brow, view, veri)
        c.  Enter a non-blank character (but not a comma or semi-colon)
            after receiving the following error messages:

            IKJ56702I INVALID MEMBER NAME, :X::?: :
            IKJ56718A REENTER THIS OPERAND+ -

 22.  For new users, you might add the following as line 7 in the
      MEMLIST and View Log panels:

      LF Listf  FN Function Menu  CAX Catalogs  TCT PDS/TSO Command Table

 23.  The COLS subcommand inserts a line into the session log
      containing column tick marks.

 24.  The ST line command (on a MEMLIST Load Member List entry)
      will display the status of a load module by issuing the ATTRIB,
      HISTORY, and MAP subcommands.

 25.  The RLSE subcommand will display a FIXPDS panel to release
      unused directory blocks or unused allocated space.

 26.  The EXPAND subcommand will display a FIXPDS panel to expand
      directory or space allocation.  This conflicts with the
      ISPF EXPAND command, so use EXPAN to display the panel.

 27.  The USAGE subcommand will display SMS data (STORCLAS, MGMTCLAS,
      DATACLAS, and DSNTYPE) if the dataset is SMS managed.

 28.  If PDS is invoked from ISPF option 3.4 (PGM=ISRUDL), the
      volser in the ISPF table display will be used instead of the
      volser that is cataloged.  Use for volumes with dsnames that
      are already cataloged (e.g., old/new/backup SYSRES).

 29.  The SET command will display the PDS Set Default Selection
      Menu.

 30.  To change LRECL to zero, issue FIXPDS RECFM(U) followed by
      FIXPDS RECFM(recfm).

 31.  To change BLKSIZE to a system-determined block size issue
      FIXPDS BLKSIZE(88888).  This will move zeros to the DCBBLKSI
      field before the CLOSE/OPEN.

      Caution:  This does not work all of the time for some file types
      (DSORG=PS).  If SDB does not determine a BLKSIZE, then it is
      set to zero.

      Suggest using PDS determined block size (PDB):
      FIXPDS BLKSIZE(99999)

 32.  For MEMLIST and IF subcommands, PREV0...PREV14 is equivalent to
      LAST(0)...LAST(14).  See PDS help member.

 33.  For the ATTRIB subcommand,
        AMODE00 and AMODEZAP are aliases for AMODE24
        SS is an alias for SECS
        APF is an alias for AUTH
        NOAPF is an alias for NOAUTH

 34.  CLIST processing is not supported from MEMLIST or ISPMODE.
      Suspend ISPF mode (special control code 1) or invoke PDS with
      the XISPMODE option.  When PDS subcommands are entered from a
      CLIST, YES/NO prompts are not provided; instead, YES responses
      are assumed in each case.

 35.  To use the extended help facility after warning and/or error
      messages have been received, enter a .?  response to the ENTER
      OPTIONS prompt message and up to five warning or error message
      explanations from the last subcommand will be requested from the
      HELP data set by the program.

 36.  The TAG command used on the command line of the MEMLIST function
      will set SUBLIST equal to selected members within the member
      list that have *TAG* in the data field.  Members can be "tagged"
      with the TAG line command.

 37.  The CONTROL DSNAME(dsname) data set can be a pre-allocated
      RECFM=VB, LRECL=any dataset.  Only the first 256 bytes of
      an output line will be retained.


 38.  If you want PDSE datasets to stand out in message PDS300A, make
      these changes to @PDSMAIN and a "+" will be inserted.

 39.  The LCS command will list Panvalet Library Control System (LCS)
      information for a load module (The Hartford Group mod).

 40.  PDS856E STOW ERROR, R15=16, R0=00000001 will result when
      FIXPDS RESETing a PDS that has a first extent of 1 track and
      1 or 2 directory blocks.  The STOW add of dummy member
      9FIXPDS fails.  The work around is to FIXPDS RESET(3) or
      comment out the AGO   .TESTTRK statement in @FIXPDS.

 41.  FIXPDS STOWINIT will issue a STOW Initialize for a PDS.

 42.  The LONG option of HISTORY will display ISPF size statistics in
      99,999,999 format for source libraries.

 43.  This directory entry appears to have a CA-Endevor footprint
      which is encrypted.  It is a CA-JCLCheck CLIST.

 47.  CONDEND in PDS works differently than CONDEND in StarTool®.

      When CONDEND is issued in a PDS batch job or CLIST, it
      will remain in effect until it is triggered by a WARNING or
      ERROR message or until CONDEND OFF is issued.

      CONDEND in StarTool® will only terminate the previous subcommand
      if it had one or more warning or error level messages.

      The subcommand groups below are equivalent.

      <PDS>
      condend errors
      copy pdshelp 'ad.help2'
      condend off
      </PDS>

      <Startool®>
      copy pdshelp 'ad.help2'
      condend errors
      </Startool®>

 48.  XISPMODE is an alias for the ISPMODE session control code 1,
      Suspend ISPF.  This is available in the Session Display and
      MEMLIST dialogs.

 49.  ALIASCHK is an alias for the ISPMODE session control code 5,
      Check Aliases.  This is available in the MEMLIST dialog.

 50.  These panels are not referenced by any other panel or dialog
      code:

      P86OPSOM  P86OPSOS  P86OPSOU  P86XP1
