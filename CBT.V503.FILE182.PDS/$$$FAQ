PDS Command Processor FAQ
-------------------------

This document is for the new PDS user who may be struggling to use
the vast number of PDS subcommands and their operands.

1.  "I took a quick look at PDS via TSO.  Some of the things displayed
    when 'help' is entered don't work."   Why?

    Some of the PDS subcommands such as BLKDISK, COMPARE, DSAT, DVOL,
    HEL, RELEASE, REVIEW and VTOC are TSO command processors and they
    must be installed and available via a TASKLIB in order to work.
    They can be installed by issuing a TSO RECEIVE on the UTILXMIT
    member of the installation library.  You can use the TSOLIB command
    to define a task library for these command processors.

    Another reason PDS subcommands might not work is improper syntax.
    The vast majority of subcommands require a "member name" or "member
    group" specification as the first positional operand.  Exceptions
    to this are the following commands:

    CHANGE   COMPRESS CONTROL  DSNAME   END      EDREC    EXEC
    FIXPDS   ISPF     ISPMODE  ISPXEQ   OPTIONS  RECALL   TSO     USAGE

    Consider the following scenario...a new user is staring at a
    MEMLIST display in dialog (aka ISPMODE) mode.  They want to find a
    string in all members in the MEMLIST display.  They enter the
    following command:

      FIND 'a needle in a haystack'

    which returns an error message about an invalid member name.

    In order to search all of the members displayed in the MEMLIST
    table, you first must make the current member group equal to
    all members in the MEMLIST display.

    SUBLIST = MEMLIST
    FIND * 'a needle in a haystack'

    Note:  See Faq #13 for additional info on invalid subcommands.

2.  Why doesn't the FIND command work?

    In dialog mode, there are two different "find" commands.

    "F"    is find in table (Log, MEMLIST, LISTA, LISTF, LISTV, ...)
    "FInd" is find in member(s) data

3.  How do I get HELP?

    In dialog mode, there are prompting panels for each subcommand.
    Enter "O" or "O.subcommand" to display the prompt panel.  A
    quick reference pop-up display panel is available via the QR
    special dialog command.  For line command help, enter "O",
    "/", or "?" in the line command area to the left.

    To display the TSO HELP member for PDS, just enter "H" or "HEL"
    to invoke full-screen help.  You can jump to the subcommand
    help section by entering "H subcommand".

      Note:  The &CHEL global variable must be set to 'HEL'
      in order to use full-screen help.

    The dialog "FN" command will display a PDS Function Selection
    panel.

4.  After exiting the ISPF tutorial via PF3, and attempting to
    immediately scroll left via PF10 on the next keystroke, why
    do I get the error message, "LEFT    " is not active?

    Press Enter immediately after exiting the tutorial, then the
    LEFT and RIGHT user variables will be set and function
    correctly.

5.  Why does the following IF command fail in batch mode?

    //TSO      EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01
    //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=name.of.pds.loadlib,DISP=SHR
    //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSIN  DD  *
    pds 'sys1.nucleus' volume(npsrs1)
    if a:z sctr noalias then(map * relink)
    end

    IF does not allow any operands on subcommands in the
    THEN or ELSE clauses.  If you use SUBLIST in the THEN
    clause, the current member group (*) can be used on a
    subsequent subcommand.  For example,

    pds 'sys1.nucleus' volume(npsrs1)
    if a:z sctr noalias then(sublist)
    map * relink
    end

6.  Why does message PDS856E STOW ERROR, R15=16, R0=00000001
    display after FIXPDS RESET subcommands on small PDS's
    with one or two directory blocks?

    This only happens if the PDS has a one track extent
    and less than 3 directory blocks.  Use FIXPDS RESET(3).

7.  Why does message PDS715E NO MATCHING ATTRIBUTES WERE FOUND
    display in the ISPMODE log after an Edit line command was
    entered in the MEMLIST table?

    Check the "Set MEMLIST Defaults" for Auto member update: YES.
    YES means that after every EDIT a MEMLIST is run on the whole
    directory for changed members (based on date and time).  If
    there were no changes, message PDS715E will display.

8.  Why do I get a data truncation error on a CAX line command?

    ***********************************************************
    * ISPV006
    *
    * Data truncation occurred
    * Data for CHAR format variable "PDSLN1" was too long.
    *
    ***********************************************************

    If you are running with the &LOGWIDE global variable set
    to YES, then you need to copy clist PDSTRAPW as PDSTRAP
    into your SYSPROC concatenation.  See member $$$TRAP.

9.  What causes a S0C4 on a USAGE ALL for a PDSE dataset?

    This happened when running PDS from an APF library.  The
    problem has been fixed in the 8.6.08 level of PDS.

10. I am trying to include a lot of members in a sublist, but
    I get an error message.

    //TSO      EXEC  PGM=IKJEFT01
    //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=pds.loadlib,DISP=SHR
    //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSIN  DD  *
    pds 'your.dataset'
    sublist (membera, memberb, memberc, memberd, membere, +
             memberf, memberg, memberh, memberi, memberj, +
             memberk, memberl, memberm, membern, membero, +
             memberp, memberq, memberr, members, membert, +
             memberu, memberv, memberw, memberx, membery, +
             memberz, member1, member2, member3, member4)
    IKJ56702I INVALID MEMBER NAME


    This is because the maximum subcommand size is 256 characters.
    Use multiple sublist subcommands with the current member
    group designator (*) to keep adding members.

    sublist (   membera, memberb, memberc, memberd, membere)
    sublist (*, memberf, memberg, memberh, memberi, memberj)
    sublist (*, memberk, memberl, memberm, membern, membero)
    sublist (*, memberp, memberq, memberr, members, membert)
    sublist (*, memberu, memberv, memberw, memberx, membery)
    sublist (*, memberz, member1, member2, member3, member4)

11. How do I display PDS message numbers in output messages?

    Enter the TSO command, PROFILE MSGID.

12. How do I find all ISPF PACKed members and turn off packing?

    find : x000140C6x then(sublist)  /* if RECFM=F */
      |
      or
      |
      v
    find : x000140E5x then(sublist)  /* if RECFM=V */
    members *  /* verify current member group before EDIT */
    edit * macro(PACKOFF)

    Note:  Starting with PDS version 8.6.16.0 you can issue
    the following IF subcommand to find PACKed members.

    if : packed then(sublist)
    members *  /* verify current member group before EDIT */
    edit * macro(PACKOFF)

    <packoff>
    ISREDIT MACRO
    CONTROL NOMSG NOFLUSH NOLIST NOCONLIST NOSYMLIST
    ISREDIT PACK = OFF
    ISREDIT END

13. ------ PDS Error Prompt Panel ------ Invalid option

    COMMAND ===> control listenv

    The above command is invalid or has invalid operands,
    correct and enter.


    When running the following dialog functions, you can only
    issue "function specific" commands that are defined in
    the PDS dialog command table (@DIATBL).

    Option   Function     -- Description --
    LA     - LISTA        Allocation list
    LF     - LISTF        File list
    LV     - LISTV        Volume list
    CAX    - CAX          Active catalog list
    TCT    - TCT          TSO command table

14. When I enter "TSO PDS" from the ISPF Command prompt
    message PDS100I does not display like it does
    when entered from the TSO READY prompt.

    If PDS was generated with the automatic ISPMODE
    (&ISPOPT SETC 'ISPMODE') option, then you will
    not receive message PDS100I with the dataset
    prompt in ISPF.

    To force message PDS100I to display, issue:

    Command ===> tso pds / xispmode

      PDS100I PDS -- VERSION 8.6.13.0  FEBRUARY 29, 2012

      IKJ56700A ENTER NAME OF DATA SET -

15. The ISPMODE session ends unexpectedly with no message
    after I enter a subcommand.

    When running in ISPMODE, certain error conditions
    cause PDS to end without displaying the error message.

    One example is message PDS832E DUMMY MEMBER ADD
    FAILED, RC=8.  This can be caused by trying to REPRO
    a null member.  Start PDS in line mode (or suspend
    ISPMODE) and run the subcommand again.  You will see
    the error message.

16. LI * NONUM does not display PDS002I before first member.

    Workaround:
    LI dummy nonum
    <PDS subcommand to build a sublist of members>
    LI

17. Example of a //PDS block command in DSLIST (Option 3.4):

DSLIST - Data Sets Matched in list RADMV347                  Row 1 of 4
Command ===>                                           Scroll ===> CSR

Command - Enter "/" to select action                  Message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
//pds / verify : DM.V347.EXEC
         AD.RACFADM.V347.MSGS
         AD.RACFADM.V347.PANELS
