  Error description:
  In order to protect the integrity of the DSCB of PDS's from:
  1. Two or more users OPEN to different members of a PDS
     dataset for output with DISP=SHR
     *** Does not apply to OPEN for UPDAT ( update )
  2. Updating the date last referenced field in the DSCB for the
     first access of the day when the first access of the day is
     for READ (DISP=SHR), also known as the midnight problem.
  Note:  This APAR adds a return code (RC30) to the ABEND213
         MSGIEC143I ABEND213-30
  Additional symptoms: MSGIEB189I

  This APAR addresses two problems.

  The first problem occurs when a user allocates a PDS with
  DISP=SHR and then opens a member for OUTPUT. The user keeps the
  partitioned dataset open through midnight. Anytime after
  midnight, a second user opens the same dataset for INPUT. The
  second OPEN reads the FMT1 DSCB to update the date last
  referenced field.  After that the first user closes the dataset
  and close writes back the FMT1 DSCB, the DS1LSTAR and DS1TRBAL
  fields would then get updated to reflect the new location of the
  modified member.  Then the second OPEN writes back the FMT1
  DSCB, the values of DS1LSTAR and DS1TRBAL will now get reset
  with their old values which would, in effect, lose the changed
  member from the first OPEN.

  The second problem occurs when two users have allocated a PDS
  with DISP=SHR and each one opens the dataset for OUTPUT to
  work on different members. One of the users updates may be lost
  because they each have the same copy of the directory and the
  last one finished will cause the directory to reflect only his
  changes. If the first user caused a new member to be added, that
  new member would no longer exist.  If the first user had
  modified a member, its directory entry will now point to the
  second users member (duplicate TTR's).

  Problem conclusion:
  The PDS corruption will be eliminated by using two new resources
  that will be enqueued upon during OPEN and CLOSE processing.
  These new enqueues will be performed only in some circumstances.
  Most of the changes are internal to the system and will not be
  noticed by the end user with one exception.

  If USERA allocates a PDS with DISP=SHR and opens the dataset for
  output and USERB allocates the same PDS with DISP=SHR and also
  attempts to OPEN this dataset for output, USERB's open will now
  fail with an ABEND213-30. This would have succeeded prior to the
  fix and almost certainly would have corrupted the directory. The
  new resources both have the same major name of SYSZDSCB. The
  minor names (rname) are similar and work together to serialize
  output to the partitioned dataset. The minor names consist of:
  VOLSER+MODE+DSN where the mode can either be an "A" or an "S".

  The resource with mode equal to "S" is enqueued upon when a PDS
  is opened with a DISPosition = SHARE (either INPUT or OUTPUT).
  The resource with mode equal to "A" is enqueued upon when a PDS
  is opened with a DISPosition = SHARE and OUTPUT. If the "A" mode
  resource is not available when needed because some other task
  has opened output shared to the PDS, an ABEND213 RC30 will be
  given to the task that is now requesting the resource. All "S"
  mode resource contention will be handled automatically.

  Note that since SYSZDSCB is ENQed SCOPE=SYSTEMS for shared DASD,
  it does not have to be specifically defined to GRS.  The effect
  of this code will be nullified if SYSZDSCB is specifically
  excluded from GRS.
